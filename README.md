blog_project
============

Blog project produced at Tech Talent South

Since it has remainder basically untouched since 2013, it's running some very old versions of Ruby and Rails. And I was just a wee coder!

As with many of these older repos, I'm just keeping it around for posterity/nostalgia. There's a newer, better one that I put together [as instructor](https://github.com/argroch/blog_app_fall15), but even that one is five years old, and I'm sure I could come up with something better if I put aside an hour or so. (Humble much?)
